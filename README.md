# Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical attributes using a Decision Tree classifier. The dataset includes various health-related attributes, and the model predicts whether the individual has diabetes (`1`) or not (`0`).
